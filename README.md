# HarborLabsEncryptedChatClient

The preliminary stages of this project involved me learning how WebRTC operated. 
After this i went on to learn how to encrypt and decrypt data with symmetric cryptography (CBC, AES) via the SJCL. After succeding with this, I went on to make use of asymmetric cryptogrophy to encrypt the AES key (elGamal, ECDSA) through the SJCL.
